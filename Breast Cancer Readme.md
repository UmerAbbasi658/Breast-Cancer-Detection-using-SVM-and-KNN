# Breast Cancer Detection Model 

# Introduction
This README provides an overview of the breast cancer detection model developed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithms.

# Project Overview
The breast cancer detection model aims to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant based on features extracted from diagnostic images. The dataset used for training and testing contains various features such as tumor size, shape, and texture.

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical format, and normalize feature values.
Data splitting was performed to create training and testing sets.

# Model Training
Two classification algorithms, KNN and SVC, were used to train the breast cancer detection model.
The KNN algorithm classifies each data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.
The SVC algorithm constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space to separate the classes.

# Model Evaluation
The trained models were evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure the generalization of the models.
# Results
Both the KNN and SVC models achieved high accuracy in classifying breast cancer tumors.
The models demonstrated good performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performance comparison between the two models was conducted to identify the best-performing algorithm.
# Usage
The trained models can be used for predicting whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant.
Users can input diagnostic features of a tumor into the model to obtain predictions.
# Dependencies
Python 3.x

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

# Conclusion
The breast cancer detection model utilizing KNN and SVC algorithms provides an effective tool for diagnosing breast cancer tumors. Further refinement and optimization of the model can enhance its performance and utility in clinical settings.
